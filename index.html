            <p class="darkgray">Our mission is to end hunger in Bangladesh through food acquisition and distribution,
                education and
                advocacy. Our vision is a Bangladesh free from hunger where everyone has equal access to nutritious food
                and medicine <br>
                A large number of the people of Bangladesh will spend tonight hungry, not knowing where their next meal
                may come from. Despite significant progress by efforts to reduce poverty in the area, the price of food
                is almost unaffordable to most, who do not earn enough due to rampant unemployment to provide for their
                families.
